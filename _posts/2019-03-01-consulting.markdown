Good data is a must have. You don't want to rely on JungleScout or any other toys that provide generic and interpolated data. Because if you do, you will end up spending time on creating reports that can't help your customer compete with other sellers.  

But good data needs explanation on how to use it : we can help you get started for your data interpretation, and suggest some visualization.

Because human brains will always be necessary, don't hesitate to talk to us !
