Even though we don't create reports, we have examples. For instance, the *Share of voice* report represents the presence of every seller on your keywords :  _The higher share a seller has, the higher ranked his products_.

We create reports for
- Natural ranking (SEO)
- Headline Search (SEA)
- Sponsored products (SEA)

This is the only way to have an accurate vision of your products performance compared to your competitors. Based on this, you can optimise sales on Amazon &co.
