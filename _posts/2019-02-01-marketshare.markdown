While in the US, Amazon has 50% of the e-commerce market share, it's a different story in France for instance. As you can see here, Cdiscount and VentePrivee are strong, and should equally be optimised. That's why according to the country you target, you need to care about other E-retailers.

DGM Radar monitors and optimises your product presence on most E-retail platforms, in many countries like the US, France, the UK, Italy, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands...

One solution, one place, to help you manage your Brand everywhere.
