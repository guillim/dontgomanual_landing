While in the US, Amazon has 50% of the ecommerce marketshare, it's a different story in France for instance. As you can see here, Cdiscount and VentePrivee are strong, and should equally be optimised. That's why according to the country you target, you need to care about other E-retailers.

DGM Radar monitors, and optimizes your product presence on most E-retail plateforms.

One solution, one place, to help you manage your Brand everywhere.
