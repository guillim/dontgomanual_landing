DGM helps you to build your customer analytics & supervision reports by scanning Amazon (and other online retailers).


Once you give us the **keywords to track**, and how often to track them, our robots will :

1. Search your _keywords_ on Amazon
2. Save product information displayed in the results into your dedicated **database**

You can then create automated report, like the famous **share of voice** report.

We provide the access to your dedicated database, and from here, you will create amazing reports with tools like *Google Data Studio*.
