Our strategy is simple. And it works. Here are the 3 main steps :

1. search for a _keyword_ on Amazon
2. score each product appearing as search results
3. repeat this every day, for hundreds of keywords
4. gather the product scores into a **share of voice** report.

The higher share a seller has, the higher ranked his products. Based on this, we can perform our recommendations.
